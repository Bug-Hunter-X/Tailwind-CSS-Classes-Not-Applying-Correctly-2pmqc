# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying as expected.  The problem is that the gray background and text color aren't being rendered correctly, appearing black instead of gray.  This is unexpected and the solution is to be found in the `bugSolution.js` file. This is a common issue that often arises from simple mistakes in class naming or order, conflicts with other CSS, or incorrect import/setup of Tailwind.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.js` which contains HTML using Tailwind classes.
3.  Observe that the styling does not apply correctly in the browser.
4.  Refer to `bugSolution.js` for a resolution.
